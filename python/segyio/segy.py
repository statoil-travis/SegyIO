segy modes

Welcome to segyio.segy. Here you will find references and examples for the
various segy modes and how to interact with segy files. To start interacting
with files, please refer to the segyio.open and segyio.create documentation, by
typing `help(segyio.open)` or `help(segyio.create)`.

The primary way of obtaining a file instance is calling segyio.open. When you
have a file instance you can interact with it as described in this module.

The explanations and examples here are meant as a quick guide and reference.
You can also have a look at the example programs that are distributed with
segyio which you can find in the examples directory or where your distribution
installs example programs.

        Memory map the file. This is an advanced feature for speed and
        optimization; however, it is no silver bullet. If your file is smaller
        than the memory available on your system this will likely result in
        faster reads and writes, especially for line modes. However, if the
        file is very large, or memory is very pressured, this optimization

        Since v1.1

        This mode gives access to reading and writing functionality of headers,
        both in individual (trace) mode and line mode. Individual headers are
        accessed via generators and are not read from or written to disk until
        the generator is realised and the header in question is used. Supports
        python slicing (which yields a generator), as well as direct lookup and
        common dict operations.

        The header can be considered a dictionary with a constant set of keys.

        Examples:
            Reading a field in a trace::
                >>> import segyio
                >>> f = segyio.open("filename")
                >>> f.header[10][TraceField.offset]

            Writing a field in a trace::
                >>> f.header[10][TraceField.offset] = 5

            Copy a header from another header::
                >>> f.header[28] = f.header[29]

            Reading multiple fields in a trace. If raw, numerical offsets are
            used they must align with the defined byte offsets by the SEGY
            specification::
                >>> f.header[10][TraceField.offset, TraceField.INLINE_3D]
                >>> f.header[10][37, 189]

            Write multiple fields in a trace::
                >>> f.header[10] = { 37: 5, TraceField.INLINE_3D: 2484 }

            Iterate over headers and gather line numbers::
                >>> [h[TraceField.INLINE_3D] for h in f.header]
                >>> [h[25, 189] for h in f.header]

            Write field in all headers::
                >>> for h in f.header:
                ...     h[37] = 1
                ...     h = { TraceField.offset: 1, 2484: 10 }
                ...

            Read a field in 10 first headers::
                >>> [h[25] for h in f.header[0:10]]

            Read a field in every other header::
                >>> [h[37] for h in f.header[::2]]

            Write a field in every other header::
                >>> for h in f.header[::2]:
                ...     h = { TraceField.offset : 2 }
                ...

            Cache a header:
                >>> h = f.header[12]
                >>> x = foo()
                >>> h[37] = x

            A convenient way for operating on all headers of a file is to use the
            default full-file range.  It will write headers 0, 1, ..., n, but uses
            the iteration specified by the right-hand side (i.e. can skip headers
            etc).

            If the right-hand-side headers are exhausted before all the destination
            file headers the writing will stop, i.e. not all all headers in the
            destination file will be written to.

            Copy headers from file g to file f:
                >>> f = segyio.open("path to file")
                >>> g = segyio.open("path to another file")
                >>> f.header = g.header

            Set offset field::
                >>> f.header = { TraceField.offset: 5 }

            Copy every 12th header from the file g to f's 0, 1, 2...::
                >>> f.header = g.header[::12]
                >>> f.header[0] == g.header[0]
                True
                >>> f.header[1] == g.header[12]
                True
                >>> f.header[2] == g.header[2]
                False
                >>> f.header[2] == g.header[24]
                True

            The header mode can also be accessed with line addressing, which
            supports all of iline and xline's indexing features.

            Rename the iline 3 to 4::
                >>> f.header.iline[3][TraceField.INLINE_3D] = 4
                >>> # please note that rewriting the header won't update the
                >>> # file's interpretation of the file until you reload it, so
                >>> # the new iline 4 will be considered iline 3 until the file
                >>> # is reloaded

            Set offset line 3 offset 3 to 5::
                >>> f.header.iline[3, 3] = { TraceField.offset: 5 }

            Since v1.3, common dict operations are supported.

            Get a list of keys and values::
                >>> f.header[10].keys()
                >>> f.header[10].values()

            Get a list of key-value pairs::
                >>> f.header[10].items()

            Get the number of keys-value pairs in a header::
                >>> len(f.header[10])

            Update a set of values::
                >>> d = { segyio.su.tracl: 10, segyio.su.nhs: 5 }
                >>> f.header[10].update(d)
                >>> l = [ (segyio.su.sy, 11), (segyio.su.sx, 4) ]

        Since v1.1

        This mode gives access to reading and writing functionality for traces.
        The primary data type is the numpy ndarray. Traces can be accessed
        individually or with python slices, and writing is done via assignment.

        All examples use `np` for `numpy`.

        Examples:
            Read all traces in file f and store in a list::
                >>> l = [np.copy(tr) for tr in f.trace]

            Do numpy operations on a trace::
                >>> tr = f.trace[10]
                >>> tr = np.transpose(tr)
                >>> tr = tr * 2
                >>> tr = tr - 100
                >>> avg = np.average(tr)

            Do numpy operations on every other trace::
                >>> for tr in f.trace[::2]:
                ...     print( np.average(tr) )
                ...

            Traverse traces in reverse::
                >>> for tr in f.trace[::-1]:
                ...     print( np.average(tr) )
                ...

            Double every trace value and write to disk. Since accessing a trace
            gives a numpy value, to write to the respective trace we need its index::
                >>> for i, tr in enumerate(f.trace):
                ...     tr = tr * 2
                ...     f.trace[i] = tr
                ...

            Reuse an array for memory efficiency when working with indices.
            When using slices or full ranges this is done for you::
                >>> tr = None
                >>> for i in range(100):
                ...     tr = f.trace[i, tr]
                ...     tr = tr * 2
                ...     print(np.average(tr))
                ...

            Read a value directly from a file. The second [] is numpy access
            and supports all numpy operations, including negative indexing and
            slicing::
                >>> f.trace[0][0]
                1490.2
                >>> f.trace[0][1]
                1490.8
                >>> f.trace[0][-1]
                1871.3
                >>> f.trace[-1][100]
                1562.0

            Trace mode supports len(), returning the number of traces in a
            file::
                >>> len(f.trace)
                300

            Convenient way for setting traces from 0, 1, ... n, based on the
            iterable set of traces on the right-hand-side.

            If the right-hand-side traces are exhausted before all the destination
            file traces the writing will stop, i.e. not all all traces in the
            destination file will be written.

            Copy traces from file f to file g::
                >>> f.trace = g.trace.

            Copy first half of the traces from g to f::
                >>> f.trace = g.trace[:len(g.trace)/2]

            Fill the file with one trace (filled with zeros)::
                >>> tr = np.zeros(f.samples)
                >>> f.trace = itertools.repeat(tr)

            For advanced users: sometimes you want to load the entire segy file
            to memory and apply your own structural manipulations or operations
            on it. Some segy files are very large and may not fit, in which
            case this feature will break down. This is an optimisation feature;
            using it should generally be driven by measurements.

        Since v1.1

        This mode gives access to reading and writing functionality for inlines.
        The primary data type is the numpy ndarray. Inlines can be accessed
        individually or with python slices, and writing is done via assignment.
        Note that accessing inlines uses the line numbers, not their position,
        so if a files has inlines [2400..2500], accessing line [0..100] will be
        an error. Note that each line is returned as a numpy array, meaning
        accessing the intersections of the inline and crossline is 0-indexed.

        Additionally, the iline mode has a concept of offsets, which is useful
        when dealing with prestack files. Offsets are accessed via so-called
        sub indexing, meaning iline[10, 4] will give you line 10 at offset 4.
        Please note that offset, like lines, are accessed via their numbers,
        not their indices. If your file has the offsets [150, 250, 350, 450]
        and the lines [2400..2500], you can access the third offset with
        [2403,350]. Please refer to the examples for more details. If no offset
        is specified, segyio will give you the first.

        Examples:
            Read an inline::
                >>> il = f.iline[2400]

            Copy every inline into a list::
                >>> l = [np.copy(x) for x in f.iline]

            The number of inlines in a file::
                >>> len(f.iline)

            Numpy operations on every other inline::
                >>> for line in f.iline[::2]:
                ...     line = line * 2
                ...     avg = np.average(line)
                ...     print(avg)
                ...

            Read inlines up to 2430::
                >>> for line in f.iline[:2430]:
                ...     print(np.average(line))
                ...

            Copy a line from file g to f::
                >>> f.iline[2400] = g.iline[2834]

            Copy lines from the first line in g to f, starting at 2400,
            ending at 2410 in f::
                >>> f.iline[2400:2411] = g.iline

            Convenient way for setting inlines, from left-to-right as the inline
            numbers are specified in the file.ilines property, from an iterable
            set on the right-hand-side.

            If the right-hand-side inlines are exhausted before all the destination
            file inlines the writing will stop, i.e. not all all inlines in the
            destination file will be written.

            Copy inlines from file f to file g::
                >>> f.iline = g.iline.

            Copy first half of the inlines from g to f::
                >>> f.iline = g.iline[:g.ilines[len(g.ilines)/2]]

            Copy every other inline from a different file::
                >>> f.iline = g.iline[::2]

            Accessing offsets work the same way as accessing lines, and slicing
            is supported as well. When doing range-based offset access, the
            lines will be generated offsets-first, i.e equivalent to:
            [(line1 off1), (line1 off2), (line1 off3), (line2 off1), ...]

            Print all line 10's offsets::

        Since v1.1

        A gather is in this context the intersection of lines in a cube, i.e.
        all the offsets at some iline/xline intersection. The primary data type
        is the numpy ndarray, with dimensions depending on the range of offsets
        specified. Offsets uses the line and offset numbers (names), not
        0-based indices.

        When using ranges over lines, a generator is returned.

        Examples:

            Read one offset at an intersection::
                >>> f.gather[200, 241, 25] # returns a samples-long 1d-array

            Read all offsets at an intersection::
                >>> f.gather[200, 241, :] # returns offsets x samples ndarray
                >>> # If no offset is specified, this is implicitly (:)
                >>> f.gather[200, 241, :] == f.gather[200, 241]

            All offsets for a set of ilines, intersecting one crossline::
                >>> f.gather[200:300, 241, :]

            Some offsets for a set of ilines, interescting one crossline::
                >>> f.gather[200:300, 241, 10:25:5]

            Some offsets for a set of ilines and xlines. This effectively yields a subcube::
                >>> f.gather[200:300, 241:248, 1:10]

        Since v1.1

        This mode gives access to reading and writing functionality for textual
        headers.

        The primary data type is the python string. Reading textual headers is
        done via [], and writing is done via assignment. No additional
        structure is built around the textual header, so everything is treated
        as one long string without line breaks.

        Examples:
            Print the textual header::
                >>> print(f.text[0])

            Print the first extended textual header::
                >>> print(f.text[1])

            Write a new textual header::
                >>> f.text[0] = make_new_header()

            Print a textual header line-by-line::
                >>> # using zip, from the zip documentation
                >>> text = f.text[0]

        Since v1.1

        This mode gives access to reading and writing functionality for the
        binary header. Please note that using numeric binary offsets uses the
        offset numbers from the specification, i.e. the first field of the
        binary header starts at 3201, not 1. If you're using the enumerations
        this is handled for you.

        Examples:
            Copy a header from file g to file f::
                >>> f.bin = g.bin

            Reading a field in a trace::
                >>> traces_per_ensemble = f.bin[3213]

            Writing a field in a trace::
                >>> f.bin[BinField.Traces] = 5

            Reading multiple fields::
                >>> d = f.bin[BinField.Traces, 3233]

            Copy a field from file g to file f::
                >>> f.bin[BinField.Format] = g.bin[BinField.Format]

            Copy full binary from file f to file g::
                >>> f.bin = g.bin

            Copy multiple fields from file f to file g::
                >>> f.bin = g.bin[BinField.Traces, 3233]

            Write field in binary header via dict::
                >>> f.bin = { BinField.Traces: 350 }

            Write multiple fields in a trace::
                >>> f.bin = { 3213: 5, BinField.SweepFrequencyStart: 17 }

            Since v1.3, common dict operations are supported.

            Get a list of keys and values::
                >>> f.bin.keys()

            Get a list of key-value pairs::

            Get the number of keys-value pairs in a header::
